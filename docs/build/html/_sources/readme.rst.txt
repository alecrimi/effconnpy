Overview
--------

``Effconnpy`` is a Python library for advanced causal inference and
connectivity analysis in time series data, offering both bivariate and
multivariate approaches. The toolbox assumes that neuroimging data
(e.g. from Nifti files) have been already pre-processed e.g. with
fMRI-prep, and parcellated, therefore the time series have been saved in
text files as .tsv and can easily be loaded into a dataframe.

Bivariate Causality Analysis
----------------------------

Two core classes provide bivariate causal inference methods:

1. CausalityAnalyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic methods include: - Bivariate Granger Causality - Bivariate
Transfer Entropy - Bivariate Convergent Cross Mapping

2. ExtendedCausalityAnalyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extended methods include: - Dynamic Bayesian Network - Structural
Equation Modeling - DoWhy Causal Discovery - Dynamic Causal Modeling

Multivariate Causality Analysis
-------------------------------

Three specialized multivariate approaches:

1. Multivariate Granger Causality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Based on methodology by Barnett & Seth, Journal of Neuroscience
   Methods 2014
-  VAR model-based causality inference
-  Log-likelihood ratio testing

2. Multivariate Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Inspired by Nithya & Tangirala, ICC 2019
-  Nonlinear causality detection
-  Network-based causal relationship visualization

3. Multivariate Transfer Entropy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Methodology from Duan et al. 2022
-  Information-theoretic causality measure
-  Supports conditional transfer entropy

N.B. The multivariate implementations are not considered
state-of-the-art and are not fully tested, please report any error or
bug.

Visualization of effective connectivity
---------------------------------------

-  Plotting of directed graphs, also overlapping with tractography and
   node labels
-  Directionality of the connections as color gradients

-  Visualization of time series over structural connections (currently
   not working properly)

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   pip install effconnpy

Quick Example
-------------

.. code:: python

   from effconnpy import CausalityAnalyzer  , create_connectivity_matrix 
   import numpy as np
   # Generate sample time series
   data = np.random.rand(100, 3)
   analyzer = CausalityAnalyzer(data)
   results = analyzer.causality_test(method='granger')
   print(results)

   binary_matrix =  create_connectivity_matrix(results, method = 'granger') 
   print(binary_matrix)

Multivariate GC Example using causal logistic maps
--------------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

   from effconnpy.multivariateGC import MultivariateGrangerCausality  
   from effconnpy import create_connectivity_matrix 
   import numpy as np

   # Generate sample time series 
   #The first 2 time series are related by a logistic causal mapping, 
   #while the third is random and has no causal relationship with the others
   # Parameters
   T = 100  # Number of time steps
   x = np.zeros(T)
   y = np.zeros(T)
   # Initial conditions
   x[0] = 0.5
   y[0] = 0.5
   # Iterate the system
   for t in range(T - 1):
       x[t + 1] = x[t] * (3.8 - 3.8 * x[t])
       y[t + 1] = y[t] * (3.1 - 3.1 * y[t] - 0.8 * x[t])
   z = np.random.rand(100)  
   data = np.vstack((x, y,z)).T   

   analyzer = MultivariateGrangerCausality(data)
   results = analyzer.multivariate_granger_causality()
   print(results)

Indeed, there is also a causal time series generator script to generate
ground-truth time series which can be complemented by random or other
time series:

.. code:: python

       from effconnpy import timeseriesgenerator
       # Create an instance of the generator
       generator = TimeSeriesGenerator()    
       # Generate some example data
       n_points = 1000
       
       # Lorenz system
       t, x, y, z = generator.lorenz_system(n_points)
       
       # Coupled logistic map
       logistic_x, logistic_y = generator.coupled_logistic_map(n_points)
       
       # Kuramoto oscillators
       kura1, kura2 = generator.kuramoto_oscillators(n_points)
       
       # AR process
       ar_x, ar_y = generator.ar_process(n_points)
       
       # Nonlinear coupled system
       nl_x, nl_y = generator.nonlinear_coupled_system(n_points)

Visualization of effective connectivity example
-----------------------------------------------

.. code:: python

   from effconnpy import  vis_effconn 

   node_file = "Node_AAL90.node"
   edge_file = "my_effconn.csv"
       
   vis_effconn(node_file, edge_file, show_tractography=True)

This will show the overlay of a tractography from the HCP dataset over a
connectome according to an atlas with given nodes coordinates, and the
effective connectivity computed and saved in a csv file. If a structural
connectivity matrix (non-effective) is passed, the function whill show
arrows on both directions for all edges.
